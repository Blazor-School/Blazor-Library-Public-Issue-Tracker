Public Bug Tracker for Blazor Library

Please submit bugs for the Blazor School team to look at here. We'd like to use the "thumbs up" reaction as an upvote to track priority from the community, so to "+1" an issue please add a thumbs up reaction to it.

Remember to be kind to everyone here - we all love programming and we're all trying to make it the best possible.

This is an experiment for the team so please be understanding as we figure out what works and what doesn't with this.

Thank you to everyone who's submitted an issue, commented on an issue or voted for an issue. This tracker is only as good as you make it, and so far it's been a very valuable tool for making Blazor Library a better Blazor component library. Thank you for making this experiment a success so far!
